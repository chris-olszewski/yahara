    <p>Called Madison, Wisconsin's "musical success story of 2013", PHOX formed when Zach Johnston began writing songs while living in San Francisco. He worked with singer Monica Martin on getting the band, a group of friends that all grew up in Baraboo, together while playing a series of shows around Madison. </p>
    <p> The band released their EP Confetti in early 2013, for which they created a video component for each track. The rest of 2013 brought their success to the next level with a Daytrotter session, postitive press, a spot at South by Southwest and a national tour opening for Blitzen Trapper. The band played Lollapalooza as a last-minute addition in August 2013, drawing a large crowd despite their midday spot. In September 2013 PHOX opened for The Lumineers at Apple's iTunes Festival in London. The band is currently managed by Onto Entertainment and heading back to the studio to work on a full-length album.</p>
