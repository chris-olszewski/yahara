<h1>About the Yahara Music Library</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Discover, collect, and enjoy music from Madison's music community.</h2>

<p>Madison has always been home to a dynamic music scene. The Yahara Music Library celebrates that fact by creating an online library of local music to share with the community. The diverse collection of music in Yahara includes established musicians and up and coming artists who play everything from rock, hip hop, classical, and more.  All <a href="http://www.scls.info/">South Central Library System</a> card holders can stream music from the Yahara Music Library using any web browser or download albums in multiple formats to a variety of devices.   </p>

<h2>Musicians matter</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/">Madison Public Library</a> established the Yahara Music Library not only to share local music but also to support local musicians. That's why you'll find more than just music in Yahara. Artist and album pages feature reviews, biographies, and information about upcoming shows, links to the musicians' websites, social media, and online stores. We hope that Yahara creates new fans and inspires listeners to support the artists who make the music.</p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<p>The Yahara Music Library was a collaborative project between the <a href="http://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/">Madison Public Library</a> and <a href="http://murfie.com/">Murfie Music</a>, Inc of Madison. </p>

<p>Madison Public Library located in Madison, WI hosts <a href="http://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/locations">nine libraries</a> and is part of the South Central Library System, a cooperative network of <a href="http://www.scls.info/about/directory.html">53 public libraries</a> in a seven county area. The system promotes reciprocal access to the resources of all member libraries making Yahara available to anyone with a valid South Central Library System card. </p>

<p>The Madison-based Murfie corporation is a modern take on the neighborhood record store. Murfie digitizes the CD collections of its customers and makes those collections available for streaming, downloading, and selling in its online marketplace.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>Murfie and the Library are releasing technical elements of the Yahara Music Library under an open source license. This means that anyone can contribute to the project's design, and other institutions can create their own iterations of the project. Yahara runs on a combination of this open source code and elements that were developed by Murfie. Institutions creating their own version of this project can develop their own system or work with Murfie to use theirs. The project can be found at github.com.</p>
